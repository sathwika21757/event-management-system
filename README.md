I've created a comprehensive event management system with React.js that's designed to be beautiful, fully-featured, and production-ready. The application includes sophisticated event discovery, creation, and management capabilities with a modern, polished design.

The system features intuitive navigation between different sections, advanced filtering and search capabilities for events, detailed event pages with registration functionality, and a comprehensive dashboard for event organizers. The design uses a sophisticated color palette with smooth animations, proper typography hierarchy, and responsive layouts that work seamlessly across all devices.

Key highlights include the multi-step event creation process with real-time preview, comprehensive event detail pages with registration tracking, and a powerful dashboard with analytics and quick actions. The entire application is built with modern React patterns, TypeScript for type safety, and uses React Router for smooth navigation between different sections.
